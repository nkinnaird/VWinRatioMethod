\title{The Vertical Waist in the Ratio Method Analysis}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This note details the handling of the vertical waist (VW) effect in the Ratio Method analysis. The 60h and Endgame datasets lie on resonances where $\omega_{VW} \approx 10 \cdot \omega_{a}$, which in combination with the fast rotation (FR) effect leads to inflated VW amplitudes in the Ratio Method, whereas one might originally assume that the VW effect can be neglected from the analysis. In the 9d dataset (not on a resonance) it was found that the Ratio Method flattened out the VW amplitudes as a function of calorimeter, leading to greater cancellation and a systematically lower calorimeter sum VW amplitude as compared to the T-Method. The solution used to eliminate these problems was to randomize out the VW (in tandem with the FR) in the data so that the effect can be acceptably ommitted from the fit.

\section{Introduction}

In the Ratio Method, or R-Method, effects with frequencies which are an even multiple of \wa divide out completely, as shown in \figref{fig:ToyMCVW}. The VW frequency is given by
    \begin{align} \label{eq:VWfreqKappa}
        f_{VW} &= f_{c} - 2 \cdot f_{y}, \\
               &= f_{c} - 2 \cdot \boldsymbol{\kappa_{VW}} \cdot f_{cbo}\sqrt{2f_{c}/(\boldsymbol{\kappa_{VW}} \cdot f_{cbo})-1},
    \end{align}
where $f_{c}$ is the cyclotron frequency, $f_{y} = \sqrt{n}f_{c}$ is the vertical betatron frequency with $n$ the quad n value, and $f_{cbo}$ is the CBO frequency. The time-dependence of the VW effect is excluded and the fit parameter is $\boldsymbol{\kappa_{VW}}$, a percent level adjustment factor to the theoretical frequency as found by both the tracking and \wa analysis \cite{cbofrequency}. Table \ref{tab:Run1Datasets} gives the VW frequencies for the Run~1 datasets. As shown the VW frequency for both the 60h and Endgame datasets are very close to an even multiple of \wa. This implies that the VW effect should be divided out in the data, unobservable, and therefore unecessary in the fit function. However, when looking at the FFT of ratio fit residuals in \figref{fig:FFT_3param}, a VW peak can be seen at early times in the 60h dataset. \figref{fig:Pvalue_Endgame} shows a fit start scan for the p value of the fit for the Endgame dataset, where the p value rises rapidly at early times. These two pieces of evidence point to the necessary inclusion of the VW in the ratio fit, even for even multiple frequency datasets.

\section{On a resonance in the 60h and Endgame datasets}

When the VW is included in the ratio fit for the 60h and Endgame results, the resulting fitted VW amplitude is signifcantly larger than that in the T-Method, $A_{VW-R} \sim 0.2 \pm 0.04$ vs $A_{VW-T} \sim 0.003 \pm 0.003$ vs. See \figref{fig:60hfitsVW}. This amplitude rises to values 10 to 100 times larger than that in the T-Method (depending on random seed) to levels which would naively seem to be directly observable by eye in the data. Interestingly enough, it is only when VW amplitude in the ratio fit is allowed to float that the VW FFT peak disappears and the fit start scans are repaired. The fit does truly seem to prefer such a large value, however this was an anomaly which needed to be understood.

One possibility considered was whether the ratio fit artificially raises the VW amplitude, and whether a different fit function should be used. Fits were done with the three parameter ratio function,
    \begin{align} \label{eq:threeparamratio}
        R(t) \approx A \cos(\omega_{a}t),
    \end{align}
as well as the full fit function,
    \begin{gather}
        R(t) = \frac{2f(t) - f_{+}(t) - f_{-}(t)}{2f(t) + f_{+}(t) + f_{-}(t)}, \\
        f_{\pm}(t) = f(t \pm T_{a}/2), \\
        f(t) = V(t) \cdot (1 + A \cdot \cos(\omega_{a}t + \phi)),
    \label{eq:fullratiofunction}
    \end{gather}
where $V(t)$ is the vertical waist effect. In the latter, $f(t)$ represents the same function used in a 5 parameter or T-Method fit function, barring the $N_{0}$ and $\tau_{\mu}$ terms which divide out. Fitting the Toy MC simulated data with these functions yielded the results shown in \figref{fig:FittedAVW_myToyMC}. For the three parameter function fits, it can be seen that the VW effect dies away as the frequency approaches 10 times \wa. For the full ratio function results however, it can be seen that the fitted VW amplitudes start to vary with large errors, typically consistent with zero. This effect makes sense, as while the VW effect has been removed from the ratio data, but the fit parameter gets divided out in the fit function, and so can be any value while still giving the same goodness of fit. The instability of this fit parameter (and it's demotivation), was originally thought to be the source of the large amplitudes in the fit to the data. However, regardless of the way the dataset was sliced, and regardless of whether the 60h or Endgame was fit, the fits always preferred a large amplitude with a relatively small error.

Therefore a more data-like Toy MC simulation was built which included the FR effect and separate calorimeters, with the ability to turn off various parts of the simulation. It was found that when the FR was turned off the ratio data was consistent with 0, while when the FR was turned on, the VW effect reappeared with a larger amplitude and a strange beating structure, \figref{fig:JamesMC_VW_FR}. A simpler Mathematica simulation revealed the same behavior with the same beating structure, \figref{fig:MathematicaMC_VW_FR}. So something in the way that the R-Method was interacting with the FR was causing these large amplitudes. Performing the R-Method analysis, but this time with varying time-shifts, revealed the resonance very clearly in both the data and the Mathematica simulation, \figref{fig:resonance}. As shown the running point for 60h and Endgame datasets sits on this resonance, stemming from the fact that $f_{VW} \approx 10 \cdot f_{a}$. This begs the questions as to what exactly is the source of this resonance, and how exactly does the R-Method introduce it in combination with the FR.

\clearpage

With yet another Toy MC, the resonances in the VW amplitude can be seen in \figref{fig:JamesAnalytic_Avw_Resonances} as a function of the time shift over the VW period, $\Delta/T_{VW}$. As shown the resonances appear at integer steps in $\Delta/T_{VW}$. Let's determine why these resonances appear by looking at the ratio fit function more carefully as a function of the time shift. The explicit ratio function is given as \cite{60hReport}
    \begin{align}
        R(t) = \frac{2 A \cos(\omega_{a}t) (1 - \cos{(\omega_{a}\Delta)})} {4 + 2A \cos(\omega_{a}t) (1 + \cos{(\omega_{a}\Delta)} )},
    \end{align}
where $\Delta$ is the time shift, typically 
    \begin{align}
        \Delta \approx T_{a}/2.
    \end{align}
In the Toy MC the \wa oscillation was removed and replaced with a VW oscillation, so the ratio function instead goes as 
    \begin{align}
        R(t) = \frac{2 A \cos(\omega_{VW}t) (1 - \cos{(\omega_{VW}\Delta)})} {4 + 2A \cos(\omega_{VW}t) (1 + \cos{(\omega_{VW}\Delta)} )},
    \end{align}
where \wa has simply been replaced by $\omega_{VW}$. Looking at the numerator of this function, it can be seen that the numerator goes to zero when 
    \begin{align}
        \Delta = 2n\pi/\omega_{VW} = n \cdot T_{VW},
    \end{align}
at integer steps in $\Delta/T_{VW}$. This can be seen in \figref{fig:ratiofunc_analytic}. When looking at the real simulated data however, including the effects of the FR, as shown in \figref{fig:ratiofunc_data}, it can be seen that the real ratio data does not in fact go to zero. This is the root cause for the VW amplitude resonances. Because the ratio function is going to zero at points where the real data is non-zero, the VW amplitude in the fit function explodes to compensate for the wrong fit function form. The 60h and Endgame datasets sit very near the point $\Delta = T_{a}/2 \approx 5 \cdot T_{VW}$, or $\omega_{VW} \approx 10 \cdot \omega_{a}$, and thus on one of these resonances.

Note that the large resonant amplitude does not mean that there is a correspondingly large wiggle in the data, as it will divide out in the full ratio function. It simply produces greater agreement between the data and the fit function. Technically the VW envelope used in the fit function is wrong for fitting the data and the Toy MC, however the VW effect is small enough in the data and the frequency is close enough to an even multiple of \wa that fits are still good. To solve this resonance and wrong envelope issue, either the real envelope should be incorporated in the fit, or the VW should be eliminated. The former is not so straightforward, as the envelope shown in \figref{fig:JamesMC_VW_FR} is complicated, though it is probably doable. The latter approach was chosen, at the disadvantage of a small hit to the statistical error, as will be described in Section~\ref{sec:randomization}.

\section{Reduction in calorimeter sum VW amplitude in the 9d Dataset}


While in the 60h and Endgame datasets the VW frequency is nearly 10 times \wa leading to the afore-discussed resonance, the 9d dataset VW frequency is closer to an odd multiple of \wa. This implies that the fitted VW amplitude should be the same between the T-Method and R-Method results. When looking at the VW amplitudes in the R-Method however, I see a systematically smaller amplitude compared to the T-Method, as shown in \figref{fig:vw-fixed-w-tau-9d-randseeds}. When looking at per calorimeter fits there is no immediately obvious difference in the results, as shown in \figref{fig:9d-PerCalo-VW}. When removing the time randomization of the cyclotron period however (used by default in order to reduce the FR effect in the data, in the T-Method fit as well as the R-Method fit), then a very clear difference in both the VW amplitudes and phases can be seen as shown in \figref{fig:9d_VW_calo_noRand}. Going back to the Toy MC with the separate calorimeters, something similar can be seen, \figref{fig:ToyMC_VW_calo_noRand}. While the phase difference plots between the two show something different, the amplitude difference plots show a slightly similar shape. In both cases, the R-Method fits tend to flatten out the per calorimeter VW amplitudes as a function of calorimeter. Since the VW phases in general run from 0 to $2\pi$, the VW amplitude of the calorimeter sum data is less than any single calorimeter. The flattening out of the VW amplitudes in the R-Method as a function of calorimeter then means that an even greater cancellation is done, leading to the systematically smaller amplitude.


Currently the best guess for the source of this flattening out is that 


-source of this flattening out exactly??

\section{Randomizing out the VW}
\label{sec:randomization}


The standard technique to remove the FR from the data as much as possible, is to not only set the bin width of the histograms as close to $T_{c}$ as possible, at 149.2 ns, but the times of the hits are randomized by $\pm T_{c}/2$. In order to remove the effects of the VW described in this document, the same strategy is used, where the times are also randomized by $\pm T_{VW}/2$. In doing so, the VW is effectively removed from the data as shown in \figref{fig:FFT_fiveParam_fVWRand}. Any attempts to fit VW parameters are unsuccessful as the VW has been successfully removed from the data. Fit start scans are also repaired as in \figref{fig:Pval_Endgame_withVWRand}. The randomization of the data by $\pm T_{VW}/2$ decreases the asymmetry $A$ of the \gmtwo wiggle by 0.006 in the 60h and Endgame datasets, and 0.0075 in the 9d dataset, corresponding to increases in the statistical error on R by $10.7 - 22.7$ ppb, where the increase can be determined as\footnote{The statistical error increase does not always exactly correspond to the change in A, but it's close, presumably do a change in statistics and fit parameter correlations.}
    \begin{align}
        \sigma_{R} \rightarrow \frac{ A_{\text{randomized}}}{A}\sigma_{R}.
    \end{align}
See Table~\ref{tab:A_change}. For the Run~1 datasets this statistical error increase was considered negligible and thus acceptable. For the forthcoming datasets it may be desirable to find an alternative solution. Attempts to randomize out the VW by randomizing out the $2f_{y}$ component from Equation~\ref{eq:VWfreqKappa} were made (before randomizing out VW directly in fact) \cite{wa_presentation}. The statistical error increase was reduced to 6~ppb and the VW was eliminated from the 60h and Endgame datasets, however there was a residual VW signal in the 9d dataset. For this reason this solution was discounted in favor of randomizing out the VW directly.
